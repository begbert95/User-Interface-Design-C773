                    Pets are nature's gift to humanity. It has been scientifically proven that opening our homes and hearts to a pet increases our longevity and improves our overall quality of life as well as the lives of our pets. At Pet Paradigm Professionals, our mission
                    is to offer resources to help you care for your furry, scaly, feathery, and slimy loved ones. Our pet experts—or “Pexperts”—have been working with pet owners and professionals alike for the past twelve years. They offer one-on-one
                    consultations with current and prospective pet owners as well as group presentations designed for veterinary, pet shelter, and pet breeding professionals. </p>
